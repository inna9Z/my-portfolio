  existing team.

- **Frustrations**: Maria has had trouble finding candidates who are both
  technically skilled and a good fit for the company culture. She has received
  applications from many candidates who are overqualified for the position and
  who are not interested in a junior role. Maria has also struggled with
  candidates who do not have good communication skills, which is important for
  collaborating with the team.
